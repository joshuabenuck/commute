This directory contains some open cv1.x based python scripts.

record.py:
Written a while back. I think it just records avi files from the first camera.

track.py:
My initial attempt at getting ball detection to work. I ended up added a bunch of configuration sliders. In the end I learned that I needed to focus on getting a set of pre-recorded images with which to experiment and that I may have been expecting too much from the Hough algorithm.
