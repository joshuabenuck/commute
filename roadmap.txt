iPhone Next Steps:
 * Downlaod and compile Geoloqi
 * Learn how they use the Google Maps APIs
 * Learn how to read the GPS
 * Learn how to read the accelerometer and gyro
 * Learn how to read the camera
 * See if a single app can stream data and read the gps/gyro/accel/camera at the same time

Adruino Next Steps:
 * Research datalog clearing bug.
 * Get WEP-only wifi adapter working.
 * Start gathering image data on laptop.
 * Research best supported linux wifi adapter.

 * Write Haar training program.
 * Learn how to unit test machine learning algorithms.
 * See if beagle board upgrade fixes wifi connection.

Long term vision:
 * Compare driving characteristics.
 * Look for sleep to commute length correlation.
 * Look for wa/or school date to commute lenght correlation.
 * Look for weather to commute length correlation.
 * Look for sunrise / sunset time to commute length correlation.
 * Detect lane changes via computer vision.

Completed:
 * Recompiled ArduCopter RC2 and read off old log data.
 * Wrote python script to pull off log data and clear log chip.
 * Manual approach appears more reliable w/ minimal extra overhead.
 * Discovered bug in clearing log data.
 * Uploaded GPS test sketch.
 * Verified GPS telemetry works.
 * Successfully compiled opencv w/ a combination of "port install" and building directly from source.
 * python -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/tty.usbserial-A700femn 115200 can be used to talk to the arucopter.
 * | tee "log-`date`" to save the session.
 * Cleanup project tote so things are more stationary / compartmentalized.
